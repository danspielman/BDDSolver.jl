# BDDSolver

Code for solving systems of linear equations in nonsingular, symmetric, block diagonally dominant (BDD) matrices.
This family includes Laplacians, SDDM matrices, and Connection Laplacians.

For examples of how to use the code, look at the notebooks in the docs directory.

This code is based on work by Rasmus Kyng and Daniel Spielman that extends the Approximate Gaussian Elimination algorithm of
Kyng and Sachdeva.

This works was supported in part by NSF grant CCF-1562041, ONR Award #N00014-16-2374,
and a Simons Investigator Award to Daniel A. Spielman.
